<h2><center>I Really Hate Being Stalled!</center></h2>
<body>
<p>Its a fact that nobody likes being stalled; or handling a very slow processing machine.</p>
<p>like there was this one time, my ex, although she was a babe, stalled me for TWO hours, because of attending a salon.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, i care about her looks and all; and that was not the reason we decided to see other people, but really, couldn't she have just told me to meet up some other day?</p>
<p>I had to travel to a different town, and to think she was really waiting for me to get there, turns out "tables turned".</p>
<p>Obviously, even after we met, the intended reason had already lacked its taste, and just had to call it a one disappointing day.</p>
