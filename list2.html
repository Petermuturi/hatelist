 <p>Meeen, do I despise big old dogs, especially untrained ones!</p>
 <p>I mean, why waste valuable time every single day, collecting poop after your dog messes around your compound; and all the other packages that come with taking care of a baby?(except daipers)</p>
 <p>I'd rather handle babies all summer. You know, you'll always keep in mind that the baby is growing up and learning new things, which accounts to less responsibility, unlike trying to teach an old dog new tricks. </p>
 <p>I mean, having a big and wreckless dog, is no difference with picking one from off a street of Nairobi and building a cage for it at your place.</p>
 <p>At the end of it all, you'll just want to put it to rest (permanently)!!</p>
