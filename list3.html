<p>Woooah, you know I kinda find rachets as another definition of mamasoko.They make life too complicated!</p>
<p>I don't know if there are ratchet guys, but really, these are the type of people who would rather see a broken relationship, than see the dream duy dating someone else.</p>
<p>The worst impression to give a rachet lady, is that she thinks you are into her.</p>
<p>There are either two things to follow up</p>
<ol>
 <li>Either to find the basics of your relationship, if in one then make sure she tries to win you</li>
 <li>Or, if she is in a relationship, she'll lay down to you all reasons, even out of this world, why you should never talk to her.</li>
<p>It's like a 24/7 or inbuilt mood-swings combined with an installation of a messed up Worst_language_dictionary all in one person </p>
<p>Yeah we all understand, they want to be treated as gods, but hold up, they aint worth a dime.</p>
<p>unless WAKE UP from a messed up fairytale and change.</p>
