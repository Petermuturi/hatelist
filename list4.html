<h2><center>Noo, Battery, Just Hold On A Little Bit Longer</center></h2>
<body>
<p>I know most of ya'll are prolly saying, "hellooo, haven't you heard of powerbanks?" but here's the thing, it's not like when someone buys a powerbank, it becomes a daily need, like clothing, that you gotta have everywhere</p>
<p>But such moments where the battery is running low and you can't do anything about it, I just let it die in peace, than on my hands.</p>
<p>But then it gets frustating, like "Just Shutdown already" but it does't happen, and will just keep on notifying "I'm dying, please don't let me die". Thats how I picture it in my head when I get a popup like "5% or less remaining. Please connect to Charger".</p>
<p>Eventually it'll just come back to life, unless the power goes out and it was dying. I just deal with it, because at that moment, prolly I don't have my laptop, or it died too.</p>
